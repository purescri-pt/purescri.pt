# How it works

Welcome to the PureScript Domain. This free service provides memorable URLs for PureScript resources.

To get started, you can search for a site from the [PureScript Domain homepage](#). Or simply visit `https://purescri.pt/<package>`, where `<package>` is the name of any [registered package](https://github.com/purescript/registry).

## For maintainers

### Libraries

If you are a library maintainer and would like to obtain a _purescri.pt_ URL, we encourage you to begin by adding your library to the [PureScript Registry](https://github.com/purescript/registry). Within 24 hours, your URL will be activated automatically. By default, it will redirect to your project's GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior.

Whether you recently published your library or already have your _purescri.pt_ URL, you can choose what happens when people visit your site:
* You can change the redirect URL to something other than your GitHub repository, such as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.
* You can mask the original URL so that your _purescri.pt_ URL remains in the browser's address bar.

To make changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/purescript-domain/purescript-domain/edit/main/sites.yaml).

### Other resources

We also offer _purescri.pt_ URLs for community resources and unpublished libraries on a limited basis. For example, you can access the PureScript Registry via https://purescri.pt/registry. If you are interested in obtaining a _purescri.pt_ URL in such a case, please [open an issue](https://github.com/purescript-domain/purescript-domain/issues/new) to discuss eligibility.

## That's it.
