#
# PureScript Domains registry
#
# To register your domain, simply add it to the list below and submit a pull
# request.
#
# Most of the time, you should configure your domain in the following format,
# where "foo" is the subdomain (as in "foo.purescri.pt") and "bar" is your
# GitHub username or organization name:
#
#   foo: bar.github.io
#
# CloudFlare provides additional security and performance features by default.
# To disable these and use DNS only, use the advanced configuration format:
#
#   foo:
#     redirect: bar.github.io
#     proxy: false
#
